## Game Programming I
Intergalactic Asteroid Defender is a multi-directional shooter game that takes place in the void of space. Traversing through the ever-expanding space, the player is tasked with the duty to clear the asteroid barrages incoming at the spaceship. Be careful, there might be something hiding behind the belt that the Intergalactic Resistance was not expecting...

## Known Bugs/ Outstanding Additions:
-Laser beams are some of the time not being properly rendered/instantiated maybe - causing pauses in the visibility of the shots.
-Did not get to implement a “boss scene” or any various versions of a boss due to time constraints
